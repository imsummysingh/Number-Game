# Number-Game

This Number Game have some rules:

1)User has 1000 INR when he starts the game
2)Every try(click on start) is charged 100 INR
3)Game is over if user has less than 100 INR
4)Every try generates three random numbers, each random number is in 0-9 range
5)If all the numbers are odd/even (eg. 2 4 6), user gets 300 INR
6)If the numbers are in sequence with difference of 1 in any order (eg. 2 3 4 or 3 2 4 or 4 6 5), user gets 800 INR
7)If all the numbers are same (eg. 4 4 4), user gets 1000 INR
8)Else user gets no money

And it is designed and made with using some extra functionality like, i had created the HTML structure before even implementing and the structure cannot be changed in anyways and by using javascript functionality it has to do work in differnet way.
